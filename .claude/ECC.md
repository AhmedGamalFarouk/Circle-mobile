# ECC components in this repo

Picked from [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) v2.2.3 (commit 4eb71d9), MIT licensed (notice below).
Only plain Markdown agents, commands and skills are vendored here. Nothing in this folder runs code on its own.

- Agents (`.claude/agents`): code-reviewer, typescript-reviewer, react-reviewer, security-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, planner
- Commands (`.claude/commands`): /react-review, /build-fix
- Skills (`.claude/skills`): react-patterns, react-performance, react-native-patterns, security-checklist, verification-loop

## Local changes from upstream

- Agent descriptions no longer say "MUST BE USED" / "PROACTIVELY", so Claude runs these subagents when asked or before a PR instead of after every edit.
- The `security-review` skill is renamed `security-checklist` so it does not shadow Claude Code's built-in `/security-review`.
- Some files link to ECC paths that are not vendored (`rules/...`, other skills/agents). Those links are dead here and can be ignored.

## Not included, and why

- **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`, ~27 entries): they need the full ECC runtime installed under `~/.claude`, log every tool call to `~/.claude` (continuous-learning observer, activity tracker), and some block edits (GateGuard, config protection). Too heavy and intrusive for a shared repo config.
- **Rules** (`rules/*`): always-on context. The common ones mandate TDD and 80% coverage, and the React/React Native ones assume TypeScript and Expo Router; Circle is JavaScript with no test suite yet.
- **MCP configs**: placeholders needing personal API keys; Firebase and GitHub are already reachable another way.
- **/security-scan** (runs `npx ecc-agentshield`, downloads and executes a package), **i18n-sync** (needs the `locakit` CLI), **/plan** and **/code-review** (shadow Claude Code built-ins).
- Everything language- or domain-specific that Circle does not use (Go, Python, Rust, Flutter, healthcare, trading, ...).
